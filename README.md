# SPART - Special Purpose Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter  

[See SPART-document.pdf for details](SPART-document.pdf)


## Overview  
Implementation of a **Special Purpose Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (SPART)** for serial I/O communication between a processor and lab workstations. Supports character input via keyboard and output to the screen using terminal applications like **PuTTY** or **HyperTerminal**.  

## Objectives  
- Familiarize with the **DE1-SoC board environment**  
- Develop a **reusable SPART module** for integration into a processor  

## Components  
### ðŸ”¹ SPART Design  
- Serial communication interface for character transmission  
- Compatible with the **ECE 554 processor environment**  

### ðŸ”¹ HDL Implementation  
- Designed in **Verilog**
- Simulated and tested before hardware implementation  

### ðŸ”¹ Integration  
- Enables serial communication with external devices
